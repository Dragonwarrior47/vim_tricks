# Commenting Code 
If you are writing code in vim, You may find yourself commenting multiple lines of code.
You can go and insert  comment on each line manually but that would be inefficient.

First, make a visual selection of the line you wish to comment. Then, use the norm command to run  
a normal mode command across all selected lines. The command to insert comment would be i followed
'#' or any character your language use as comment.
